                                            that are on multiple platforms. We work hard to ensure this service works to
                                            its full potential and meet each case with the utmost dedication. We
                                            understand how important a secure website is to e-commerce. Our investment

                                            Unfortunately, our service is reliant on 3rd party providers that may have

                                            Some of CedCommerce Services are billed on a subscription basis means that
                                            you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (each period is
                                            called a “billing cycle”). Billing cycles are typically two weeks, monthly
                                            or annual, depending on what subscription plan you were offered. Your
                                            Subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle
                                            unless you cancel auto-renewal through your online account management page,
                                            or by contacting our customer support team. While we will be sad to see you
                                            go, you may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription at any time, in which
                                            case your Subscription will continue until the end of that billing cycle
                                            before terminating. You may cancel auto-renewal on your Subscription
                                            immediately after the Subscription starts if you do not want it to renew.

                                            We may change the subscription fee charged for the Services at any time. The
                                            change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing
                                            cycle of your subscription.

                                            For users subscribed under Free Subscription Plan- If they choose to
                                            unsubscribe before or after the subscription end without subscribing to the
                                            Paid Plans then any Product which got published on your Shopping Engine
                                            Merchant Center through CedCommerce Shopping Feed would get retired from
